# DNA Sequencing Setup and Preparations 
## Tool that synchronizes DNA sequencing results from multiple platforms, including ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer, ANDE, and RapidHIT systems. 

Python & application setup
1.	Check if python is installed
•       Open a new Command Prompt window.
•       Type python --version if If Python is installed, it will display the version number. If not, it will show an error message.
•       For python installation please follow the steps in the Python Installation guide.docx file
2.	Once python is installed, click the DNA analyzer installer.bat file for application installation, once finished installing the needed requirements the application will start.
3.	An application clickable is created for future usage (without future installation process needed again) place it where you please for later use.
note- the application shorcut is linked to the loaction of DNA analyzer installer.bat and if the folder will be moved the shorcut will not work.


Application Usage
2.	Input Folder:
o	The program is designed to process folders within a larger folder, the code looks for the relevent files for analysis. If this method proves ineffective, consider directly placing the XML and TXT result files you wish to analyze into the input folder for processing.
o	The application supports XML files in CODIS and NIEM  formats, and TXT files containing allele data.
o	Make sure to place only files in the format of the machine output
3.	Output Folder:
o	Choose an output folder where the results will be saved. If not specified, the results will be saved in the same directory as the input folder.
